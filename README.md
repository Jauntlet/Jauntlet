# Jauntlet
Jauntlet is an open-source game engine with a focus on performance and a fast workflow. 

Whilst Jauntlet is still heavily in development and not ready for outside individual use, here are a few goals we wish to achieve as we go further into production:

- If your game doesn't use it, it isn't in your game - We are tired of game engines that boggle down performance by running hundreds of operations from dozens of systems your game doesn't use. It's there if you need it, but MIA otherwise.
- Low-Level control - If our pre-built systems don't work for your game, you shouldn't have to find some shabby workaround to get the system to work for it anyway.
- Intuitive - When you need a feature, you should be able to easily find it, and easily comprehend how it works.

these goals may change or increase in size.

# Using Jauntlet

# Using Jauntlet Source
This segment is for if you want to be able to change the source of Jauntlet at the same time you are developing your game, a relatively unique advantage to an open-source engine.

The method we recommend for using Jauntlet is via Github submodules, which will link Jauntlet directly to your github repository.
